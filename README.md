- 👋 Hi, I’m @tquadrat, or Thomas Thrien in real live.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general and Java in particular. Aside that, I am collecting Teddy Bears, LEGO®, books and movies on BluRay, and I am an avid sports shooter and archer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, Gradle and IntelliJ IDEA after I was using Subversion, Maven and Eclipse in the past.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on … to be honest, lots of stuff, but I do not have time enough to provide significant contributions to any project.
- 📫 How to reach me: send me an email to tquadrat.do@gmail.com or ping me on Telegram at @tquadrat_do
