- 👋 Hi, I’m @tquadrat, or Thomas Thrien in real live.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general and Java in particular. Aside that, I am collecting Teddy Bears 🧸, LEGO®, books 📚 and movies 🎞 on BluRay, and I am an avid sports 🏆 shooter 🔫 and archer 🏹.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, Gradle and IntelliJ IDEA after I was using Subversion, Maven and Eclipse in the past.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on … to be honest, lots of stuff, but I do not have time enough to provide significant contributions to any project.
- 📫 How to reach me: send me an email to tquadrat.do@gmail.com or ping me on Telegram at @tquadrat_do
- ⏰ Currently, I am building my own solution for a home automation.
- 🦠 I am fully jabbed, and if additional shots are required, I will take them – although I hate 💉 to be poked with needles …
